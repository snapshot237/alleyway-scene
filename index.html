            WHAM! The jerk hammers Steve in the jaw, knocking him into a line of garbage cans. Steve groans...and GETS BACK UP. Steve’s a natural fighter, bobbing and scoring a kidney punch, but the guy barely feels it. The jerk swings. STEVE tries to BLOCK WITH A TRASH CAN LID. The jerk yanks away the lid and pounds him again. Steve’s feet lift off the ground. HE HITS THE CEMENT HARD. For a moment, Steve lays still. The jerk hovers, panting. THEN STEVE GETS TO HIS FEET AGAIN. The jerk shakes his head. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>LOUD JERK</b> You just don’t know when to give up, do you?
        </p> 
        <p> 
            <b>STEVE</b> (wiping his bloody mouth) I can do this all day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The jerk knocks Steve back into a pile of garbage. He moves to hit him...BUT SOMEONE GRABS HIS ARM.
        </p> 
        <p>
            <b>BUCKY (O.S.)</b> What's with all the fighting?
        </p>
        <p>
            The jerk spins to see A SOLDIER, JAMES “BUCKY” BARNES.
        </p> 
        <p>
            <b>BUCKY (CONT'D)</b> Don't you know there's a war on?
        </p>
        <p>
            The jerk takes a swing. Bucky SLUGS him, spins him around, and PLANTS an army boot in the ass. The jerk runs away. Bucky looks down at Steve, getting up from a pile of garbage.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>BUCKY (CONT’D)</b> Sometimes I think you like getting punched.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>STEVE</b> I had him on the ropes.
        </p> 
        <p>
            As Steve gets up, a folded ENLISTMENT FORM falls from his pocket. Bucky picks it up and reads.
        </p> 
        <p>
            <b>BUCKY</b> How many times is this? (reads) And you’re from Paramus now? It’s still illegal to lie on an enlistment form, and seriously, Jersey? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Steve frowns, TAKING IN BUCKY’S UNIFORM.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>STEVE</b> Looks like you got your orders.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>BUCKY</b> 107th ships to England first thing tomorrow. (beat) This is my last night.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>STEVE</b> So, what’s the first stop? Church? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Bucky grins.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>BUCKY</b> Yeah...maybe second stop.
        </p>
        <p>
            They start walking out of the alley.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>STEVE</b> Where are we going?
        </p>
        <p>
            He whips out a newspaper and hands it to Steve.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>BUCKY</b> The future.
