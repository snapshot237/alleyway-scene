        <p> WHAM! The jerk hammers Steve in the jaw, knocking him into a line of garbage cans. Steve groans...and GETS BACK UP. Steve’s a natural fighter, bobbing and scoring a kidney punch, but the guy barely feels it. The jerk swings. STEVE tries to BLOCK WITH A TRASH CAN LID. The jerk yanks away the lid and pounds him again. Steve’s feet lift off the ground. HE HITS THE CEMENT HARD. For a moment, Steve lays still. The jerk hovers, panting. THEN STEVE GETS TO HIS FEET AGAIN. The jerk shakes his head. 
        </p>
        <b>LOUD JERK</b> 
        You just don’t know when to give up, do you? 

STEVE 
(wiping his bloody mouth)
I can do this all day. 

The jerk knocks Steve back into a pile of garbage. He moves to hit him...BUT SOMEONE GRABS HIS ARM. 

BUCKY (O.S.) 
What’s with all the fighting? 

The jerk spins to see A SOLDIER, JAMES “BUCKY” BARNES. 

BUCKY (CONT’D) 
Don’t you know there’s a war on? 

The jerk takes a swing. Bucky SLUGS him, spins him around, and PLANTS an army boot in the ass. The jerk runs away. Bucky looks down at Steve, getting up from a pile of garbage. 

BUCKY (CONT’D) 
Sometimes I think you like getting punched. 

STEVE 
I had him on the ropes. 

As Steve gets up, a folded ENLISTMENT FORM falls from his pocket. Bucky picks it up and reads. 

BUCKY 
How many times is this? 
(reads)
And you’re from Paramus now? It’s 
still illegal to lie on an 
enlistment form, and seriously, 
Jersey? 

Steve frowns, TAKING IN BUCKY’S UNIFORM. 

STEVE 
Looks like you got your orders. 

BUCKY 
107th ships to England first thing tomorrow. 
(beat)
This is my last night. 

STEVE 
So, what’s the first stop? Church? 

Bucky grins. 

BUCKY 
Yeah...maybe second stop.

They start walking out of the alley. 

STEVE 
Where are we going? 

He whips out a newspaper and hands it to Steve. 

BUCKY 
The future.
